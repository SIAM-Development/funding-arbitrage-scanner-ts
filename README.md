# funding-arbitrage-scanner-ts
A funding rate arbitrage bot created to scan crypto markets for changes in premiums across exchanges, looking for arbitrage trades. This bot cannot create trades on its own, only locates opportunities to do so. Can be used for educational purposes or as part of your own funding rate arbitrage system.
